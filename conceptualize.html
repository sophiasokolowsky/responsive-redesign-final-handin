      <div id="buttons">
        <button onclick="showText('text1')" class="button-1">Accessibility:</button>
        <p id="text1" class="hidden-box">
          This webpage is only accessible if the user has access to a desktop computer with a mouse. Attempting to navigate through 
          the page using only a keyboard results in only being able to access 2 of the 13 major components. When trying to use the 
          webpage on a mobile device, the text becomes too small to read, components do not stack correctly, the user loses access 
          to two of the components in the navigation bar, and the overall functionality of the webpage falls apart.          
        </p>

        <button onclick="showText('text2')" class="button-1">Efficiency:</button>
        <p id="text2" class="hidden-box">When a user clicks any of the interactive components, they load in the same tab, causing 
          the user to have to either press the back button (which then usually results in improper loading of the webpage's 
          contents) or manually searching for the landing page again. This also negates the usability of the 'home button' in 
          the header, as once a user leaves the homepage, the icon disappears.</p>

        <button onclick="showText('text3')" class="button-1">Learnability:</button>
        <p id="text3" class="hidden-box">Upon accessing this webpage for the first time, it would be very difficult for users to 
          navigate the page without assistance. They would discover that 3 of the interactive components have no purpose (i.e. 
          You click the dropdown menu for there to be one option which is the same as the title of the dropdown menu). They would 
          also discover that a few of the boxes in the main content section are interactive buttons all with different hover 
          features, and the rest are not interactive at all.</p>

      <div id="buttons">
        <button onclick="showText('text4')" class="button-1">General Design Issues:</button>
        <p id="text4" class="hidden-box">The text is written in very fine, very small print which makes it difficult to read. This 
          is very important given the opening message on the site is meant to alert users to information security concerns upon 
          them logging into the site with their credentials. Additionally, the page has no clear hierarchy, making it confusing 
          for users to navigate. Lastly, the color palette is hard on the eyes due to poor contrast and coordination.
        </p>

        <button onclick="showText('text5')" class="button-1">Conceptual Model Misalignment:</button>
        <p id="text5" class="hidden-box">When accessing a United States military webpage, the typical user would assume the 
          webpage to be functional and well designed as the military provides the country's most highly-trained cybersecurity and 
          computer science specialists. Additionally, one would think the military wants to portray themselves as being 
          professional, attentive to detail, and excellent at what they do. This is not reflected in this webpage.</p>
