      <div id="buttons">
        <button onclick="showText('text1')" class="button-1">Efficiency:</button>
        <p id="text1" class="hidden-box">The search bar is a small icon in the top right corner which is difficult to find quickly. The homepage has two 
            navigation bars - a side panel with limited options and a dropdown above it which is confusing. The focus of the page is cleaning products, 
            which may mislead users since it is a grocery store website. This could lead to users not using the page efficiently or maybe not even using the page at all!
            </p>

        <button onclick="showText('text2')" class="button-1">Learnability:</button>
        <p id="text2" class="hidden-box">The page lacks a clear visual hierarchy, which makes  it hard for users to distinguish different sections. Clickable 
            elements don&#39;t change on hover, making it unclear whether they are clickable or decorative. This makes it difficult for users to learn how to 
            navigate the website.</p>

        <button onclick="showText('text3')" class="button-1">Memorability:</button>
        <p id="text3" class="hidden-box">The lack of a clear grocery store theme makes it difficult  for users to remember the site's purpose. A cluttered 
            layout with mixed information complicates navigation, making it hard for users to remember how to find specific sections.</p>
      </div>

      <div id="buttons">
        <button onclick="showText('text4')" class="button-1">Conceptual Model:</button>
        <p id="text4" class="hidden-box">The website's conceptual model does not align with user expectations for a grocery store. Instead, it resembles a 
            newspaper or blog, with a confusing focus on cleaning products. This misalignment creates confusion and hinders its usability.</p>

        <button onclick="showText('text5')" class="button-1">General Design:</button>
        <p id="text5" class="hidden-box">The website's general design issues have a negative impact on its efficiency, learnability, and memorability, making 
            its functionality less intuitive. While WebAIM WAVE detected no errors, I think some text is too small, such as the subheadings, which if larger, 
            could improve section differentiation. Although there are no contrast issues, the color scheme could be improved to create a more appealing and 
            digestible webpage.</p>

            function showText(id) {
                const element = document.getElementById(id);
                if (element.style.display === "none") {
                    element.style.display = "block";
                } else {
                    element.style.display = "none";
                }
            }
        </script>
