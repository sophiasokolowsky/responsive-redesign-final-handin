      <h1>Where Design Meets Security</h1>
      <p>I recently joined the United States Air Force and was asked to sign some forms online through their portal. Upon loading into
        the Air Force's Holm Center Homepage, I was shocked to see how poorly designed it was! I couldn't read any of the text, and I could not
        figure out where to login or even which buttons I could press! I decided to redesign their webpage as my own personal project.
        I focused on improving the page's responsiveness and user functionality... click the links below or in the menu above to discover
        how I went about it!
